# COVID-19 Germany local incidence and ICU occupancy (in German)
> "Some time ago at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to create a Twitter bot to automatically gather the latest data in Germany and share it to the Twittersphere. I also created and deployed a dashboard heroku app (links below). I was motivated by the lack, at the time, of easily accessible incidence and ICU occupancy data at a local and city level. Back then, only aggregated data by _Bundesland_ and at a national level were available through the official Robert Koch Institute website. Meanwhile, both the RKI and DIVI for ICU data have improved their dashboard data granularity. I still maintain both the Twitter bot and the dashboard, as they run with little overhead.
