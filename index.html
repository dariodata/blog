Hi! I'm a data scientist / neuroscientist / cat lover interested in the complex
dynamics of the world we live in and how we can use data _and_ science to solve
humanity's big and small challenges. One idea at a time.

Fun fact: I started university when I was 15 years old and got my PhD at 25,
and, while I wouldn't recommend it, this has allowed me to explore many of my
interests throughout my life and to develop a diverse and unique set of skills
