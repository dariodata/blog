    "# COVID-19 Germany local incidence and ICU occupancy (in German)\n",
    "> \"Some time ago at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to create a Twitter bot to automatically gather the latest data about the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and share it to the Twittersphere. I also created and deployed a [dashboard heroku app](https://corona7tage.herokuapp.com). I was motivated by the lack, at the time, of local (county and city level) easily accessible incidence and ICU occupancy data. Back then only aggregated data by Bundesland and at a national level were available through the official Robert Koch Institute dashboard. Meanwhile, both the RKI and DIVI (for ICU data) have improved their dashboard data granularity. I still maintain both the Twitter bot and the dashboard, as they run with little overhead.\"\n",
