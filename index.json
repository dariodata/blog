For each, two versions of the feature set were used: all features (local + neighborhood-aggregated) and only local features (without neighborhood information).\nThe best model was a Random Forest trained with all features: its performance was impaired when the aggregated features were removed. The best graph-based neural network model was APPNP and its performance was better when only local features were used. APPNP performed better than an MLP with comparable complexity, indicating that the graph structure information gave it an advantage. Finally, the best GCN model required using all features and several strategies to reduce overfitting. The excellent performance of a Random Forest shows that it makes sense to consider simple models when faced with a new task. It also indicates that the individual node features in the Elliptic dataset are already informative enough to make good predictions. It would be interesting to explore how the model performs, when fewer samples and/or features are available for training.\nA shallow GCN with 2 layers might not be a good choice for node classification of a graph as sparse as the bitcoin transaction graph. If a node has few incoming edges, a graph convolution may not have enough neighbors with features to aggregate.\nAn interesting solution is provided by the APPNP model, which combines message passing with the teleportation principle of personalized pagerank. The long-range (20 iterations in the best model) of the predictions propagation through the network is an aspect that deserves further attention in the future.\nThe main performance metrics for comparison were:\nModel Features Dropout Precision Recall F1 score GCN all 0.5 0.8051 0.4958 0.6137 GCN local 0. 0.6667 0.4617 0.5456 APPNP all 0.2 0.7791 0.6251 0.6936 APPNP local 0. 0.8158 0.6787 0.7409 MLP all 0.2 0.6538 0.6593 0.6565 MLP local 0. 0.7799 0.6740 0.7231 RandomForest all 0.9167 0.7211 0.8072 RandomForest local 0.8749 0.7036 0.7799 Disclaimer: This was a hobby project done mostly nocturnally and on the weekends out of pure fascination for graph theory and neural networks.

The transactions are represented as a graph containing 203769 nodes (transactions) and 234355 edges (bitcoin flow from one transaction to another). A subset of the transactions are labeled as licit or illicit. A detailed description of the dataset and an initial approach applying graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for the task of node classification has been addressed by:\nM. Weber, G. Domeniconi, J.

The complete script for the analysis is in eda.py, which generates a detailed report including multiple correlations. The main findings from the report can be summarized as:\n29 features are highly skewed 76 features are highly correlated to other features in the dataset (Spearman correlation coefficient $\\rho \u0026gt; 0.90$) 21 aggregated features are highly correlated to other aggregated features 54 local features are highly correlated to other local features time_step is highly correlated with aggr_43 ($\\rho = 0.91$) Constructing the transaction graph We now have our data prepared in table format, but we want to be able to work on the graph constructed from the data. In order to create our transaction graph, we use the networkx package. We create a directed multigraph (a directed graph that allows for multiple edges between two nodes) and add the label attribute to each transaction.\n# create networkx graph from the pandas dataframes g_nx = nx.MultiDiGraph() g_nx.add_nodes_from( zip(df_classes[\u0026#34;txId\u0026#34;], [{\u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: v} for v in df_classes[\u0026#34;label\u0026#34;]]) ) g_nx.add_edges_from(zip(df_edges[\u0026#34;txId1\u0026#34;], df_edges[\u0026#34;txId2\u0026#34;])); print(f\u0026#34;Graph with {g_nx.number_of_nodes()} nodes and {g_nx.number_of_edges()} edges.\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Number of connected components: {len(list(nx.weakly_connected_components(g_nx)))}\u0026#34;) Graph with 203769 nodes and 234355 edges. Number of connected components: 49 We can confirm that there are 49 connected components (weakly connected compoments in the case of directed graphs) was constructed for each timestep. This means that the dataset consists of 49 different subgraphs, each corresponding to one timestep.\n# create list of graphs, one for each timestep components = list(nx.weakly_connected_components(g_nx)) g_nx_t_list = [g_nx.subgraph(components[i]) for i in range(0,len(components))] with sns.axes_style(\u0026#39;white\u0026#39;): fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(12,6)) for i,t in enumerate([26,48]): node_label = list(nx.get_node_attributes(g_nx_t_list[t], \u0026#39;label\u0026#39;).values()) mapping = {-1:\u0026#39;grey\u0026#39;, 0:\u0026#39;C0\u0026#39;, 1:\u0026#39;C3\u0026#39;} node_color = [mapping[l] for l in node_label] nx.draw_networkx(g_nx_t_list[t], node_size=10, node_color=node_color, with_labels=False, width=0.2, alpha=0.8, arrowsize=8, ax=ax[i]) leg = ax[0].legend([\u0026#39;unlabeled\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;licit\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;illicit\u0026#39;]) leg.legendHandles[0].set_color(\u0026#39;grey\u0026#39;) leg.legendHandles[1].set_color(\u0026#39;C0\u0026#39;) leg.legendHandles[2].set_color(\u0026#39;C3\u0026#39;) plt.tight_layout() /anaconda3/envs/dgl/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py:579: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: The iterable function was deprecated in Matplotlib 3.1 and will be removed in 3.3.

Moreover, there graph does not seem to be particularly dense. There seem to be chains of transactions one after the other. Also, many of these chains seem to concentrate one type of labeled transaction: either licit or illicit. Finally, a minority of nodes seems to have a larger number of edges, connecting with transactions in multiple chains or further away from their inmediate neighborhood.\nGraph metrics We can calculate selected graph metrics to better quantify some important structural properties of the transaction graph.\ng_metrics = {} g_metrics[\u0026#39;timestep\u0026#39;] = np.arange(1,50) g_metrics[\u0026#39;number_of_nodes\u0026#39;] = [graph.number_of_nodes() for graph in g_nx_t_list] g_metrics[\u0026#39;avg_degree\u0026#39;] = [np.mean(list(dict(nx.degree(graph)).values())) for graph in g_nx_t_list] g_metrics[\u0026#39;density\u0026#39;] = [nx.density(graph) for graph in g_nx_t_list] g_metrics[\u0026#39;avg_clustering\u0026#39;] = [nx.average_clustering(nx.DiGraph(graph)) for graph in g_nx_t_list] g_metrics[\u0026#39;avg_shortest_path\u0026#39;] = [nx.average_shortest_path_length(nx.DiGraph(graph)) for graph in g_nx_t_list] fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(g_metrics)-1,1, figsize=(10,6), sharex=True) for i,label in enumerate(list(g_metrics.keys())[1:]): ax[i].bar(g_metrics[\u0026#39;timestep\u0026#39;], g_metrics[label], label=label) ax[i].legend() plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;timestep\u0026#39;); print(f\u0026#34;Average density of the graphs across all timesteps: {np.mean(g_metrics[\u0026#39;density\u0026#39;]):.6f}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Average degree of all nodes across all timesteps: {np.mean(list(dict(nx.degree(g_nx)).values())):.2f}\u0026#34;) Average density of the graphs across all timesteps: 0.000318 Average degree of all nodes across all timesteps: 2.30 Given the density of the transaction graph, it seems to be rather sparse. The average density accross all timesteps lies around 0.0003177 and each node has an average of 2.30 edges. In comparison, the Cora dataset (popularly used as a benchmark of node classification algorithms) has an average degree of 3.90 and a density of 0.0014812. With only 2708 nodes, Cora is a much smaller and denser graph.\nTraining a Graph Convolutional Network To build and train the GCN, I used DGL as a framework for deep learning on graphs DGL is based on pytorch and uses DGLGraph objects that can be easily created from networkx graphs. Moreover, several implementations of graph-based neural layers are available in DGL.\nGraph creation First we create the DGLGraph from a networkx Graph. We also add the label information as a tensor to the node data in the DGLGraph (from now on simply \u0026ldquo;graph\u0026rdquo;). Similarly, we add the node feature matrix to the graph as a tensor of shape (number of nodes, number of features) = (203769, 166).\nImportantly, I tested the performance of the GCN using two options for constructing the graph:\nUnidirectional edges: edges going from one transaction to the next. In a GCN, this would mean that information used by the model to classify nodes would flow in one direction (downstream) only. In this case, we use g_nx directly. Bidirectional edges: edges are made bidirectional, which would allow information flow in a GCN to travel in both directions (downstream and upstream). In this case, we use g_nx.to_undirected().to_directed(), i.e. we first make the edges undirected, and then back again directed. By doing so, networkx makes the edges in the resulting graph bidirectional. It is not explicitely stated in the paper, which of these two options was used by Weber et al. However, from the performance metrics, it is likely that they used the bidirectional edges version.\n# create unidirectional graph g = dgl.DGLGraph() g.from_networkx(g_nx) g.ndata[\u0026#34;label\u0026#34;] = torch.tensor( df_classes.set_index(\u0026#34;txId\u0026#34;).loc[sorted(g_nx.nodes()), \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;].values ) g.ndata[\u0026#34;features_matrix\u0026#34;] = torch.tensor( df_features.set_index(\u0026#34;txId\u0026#34;).loc[sorted(g_nx.nodes()), :].values ) print(g) DGLGraph(num_nodes=203769, num_edges=234355, ndata_schemes={'label': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64), 'features_matrix': Scheme(shape=(166,), dtype=torch.float64)} edata_schemes={}) # make unidirectional edges bidirectional in networkx g_nx_bidirectional = g_nx.to_undirected().to_directed() # create bidirectional graph g_bi = dgl.DGLGraph() g_bi.from_networkx(g_nx_bidirectional) g_bi.ndata[\u0026#34;label\u0026#34;] = torch.tensor( df_classes.set_index(\u0026#34;txId\u0026#34;).loc[sorted(g_nx.nodes()), \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;].values ) g_bi.ndata[\u0026#34;features_matrix\u0026#34;] = torch.tensor( df_features.set_index(\u0026#34;txId\u0026#34;).loc[sorted(g_nx.nodes()), :].values ) print(g_bi) DGLGraph(num_nodes=203769, num_edges=468710, ndata_schemes={'label': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64), 'features_matrix': Scheme(shape=(166,), dtype=torch.float64)} edata_schemes={}) Graph normalizaiton The performance of the GCN benefits from using a normalized version of the adjacency matrix. I applied a common normalization approach used in the literature. It starts by adding a self-loop to each node, which is the equivalent of adding the identity matrix to the adjacency matrix A $$\\tilde{A} = A + I$$The rest of the normalization consists of obtaining the normalized graph Laplacian (here is a great overview explaining what the Laplacian means), which can be calculated as $$\\hat{A} = D^{-1/2}\\tilde{A}D^{-1/2}$$ where $D$ is a matrix whose diagonal contains the degree of each node of $\\tilde{A}$.\nThis matrix multiplication notation effectively means that the normalized Laplacian can have as a value in each $(i,j)$ position: $$\\hat{A}(i,j) = \\begin{cases} 1 \u0026 \\text{if $i=j$} \\\\[2ex] {-1 \\over {\\sqrt{\\deg(i)\\deg(j)}}} \u0026 \\text{if $i \\neq j$ and $(i,j) \\in E$},\\\\[2ex] 0 \u0026 \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$ where $E$ is the set of edges of the graph. As we can see, nodes with an (in)degree of zero could be troublesome, which is why we add the self-loops.\n# add self loop g.add_edges(g.nodes(), g.nodes()) print(g) # add self loop to the bidirectional edges graph g_bi.add_edges(g_bi.nodes(), g_bi.nodes()) print(g_bi) DGLGraph(num_nodes=203769, num_edges=438124, ndata_schemes={'label': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64), 'features_matrix': Scheme(shape=(166,), dtype=torch.float64)} edata_schemes={}) DGLGraph(num_nodes=203769, num_edges=672479, ndata_schemes={'label': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64), 'features_matrix': Scheme(shape=(166,), dtype=torch.float64)} edata_schemes={}) Train/validation data splitting Now that our graph is ready, we need to split our data into training and validation sets. We will follow the same approach taken by Weber et al., which consists in a time-based split using the initial 70% of the timesteps to train the model and the remaining 30% for validation. This temporal split makes sense in the context of possible applications of such a model. A company could continuosly use their older historical data and labels for training and then predict the node classes for more recent transactions.\nfeatures = g.ndata[\u0026#34;features_matrix\u0026#34;].float() labels = g.ndata[\u0026#34;label\u0026#34;].long() # format required for cross entropy loss in_feats = features.shape[1] n_classes = 2 # licit or illicit (unknown label is ignored) n_edges = g.number_of_edges() dataset_size = df_classes[\u0026#34;label\u0026#34;].notna().sum() train_ratio = 0.7 train_time_steps = round(len(np.unique(features[:, 0])) * train_ratio) shutdown_timestep = 43 train_indices = ( ((features[:, 0] \u0026lt;= train_time_steps) \u0026amp; (labels != -1)).nonzero().view(-1) ) val_indices = ( ((features[:, 0] \u0026gt; train_time_steps) \u0026amp; (labels != -1)).nonzero().view(-1) ) # timestep_indices = { # t:( # ((features[:, 0] == t) \u0026amp; (labels != -1)).nonzero().view(-1) # ) for t in range(train_time_steps+1,50) # } print(f\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Number of timesteps used for training: {train_time_steps} Number of timesteps used for validation: {dataset_size-train_time_steps}\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) Number of timesteps used for training: 34 Number of timesteps used for validation: 203735 GCN model architecture For the GCN model, I used the implementation from DGL, which is based on the original implementation used by Kipf et al. (2016). In short, the algorithm is given by the formula\n$$H^{(l+1)} = \\sigma (D^{-1/2}\\tilde{A}D^{-1/2}H^{(l)}W^{(l)})$$where $\\sigma$ is the activation function (ReLu), $D^{-1/2}\\tilde{A}D^{-1/2}$ is the normalized graph Laplacian, $H^{(l)}$ are the logits and $W^{(l)}$ are the learnable weights of the $l$th layer of the neural network. It is also possible to add a learnable bias to each layer. There are some very good explanations of how this algorithm works available for reference.\nclass GCN(nn.Module): def __init__( self, g, in_feats, n_hidden, n_classes, n_layers, activation, dropout, bias ): super(GCN, self).__init__() self.g = g self.layers = nn.ModuleList() # input layer self.layers.append( GraphConv(in_feats, n_hidden, activation=activation, bias=bias) ) # hidden layers for _ in range(n_layers - 2): self.layers.append( GraphConv(n_hidden, n_hidden, activation=activation, bias=bias) ) # output layer self.layers.append(GraphConv(n_hidden, n_classes, bias=bias)) self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=dropout) def forward(self, features): h = features for i, layer in enumerate(self.layers): if i != 0: h = self.dropout(h) h = layer(self.g, h) return h # utility function to evaluate the model def evaluate(model, loss_fcn, features, labels, mask): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Calculate the loss, accuracy, precision, recall and f1_score for the masked data\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; model.eval() with torch.no_grad(): logits = model(features) logits = logits[mask] labels = labels[mask] loss = loss_fcn(logits, labels) _, indices = torch.max(logits, dim=1) correct = torch.sum(indices == labels) p, r, f, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(labels, indices) return loss, correct.item() * 1.0 / len(labels), p[1], r[1], f[1] # utility function to obtain a confusion matrix def eval_confusion_matrix(model, features, labels, mask): model.eval() with torch.no_grad(): logits = model(features) logits = logits[mask] labels = labels[mask] _, indices = torch.max(logits, dim=1) print(confusion_matrix(labels, indices)) Model training Now we can train the model using the specifications from the paper by Weber et al.:\ncross entropy loss function putting higher weight for the positive (illicit) samples: 0.7 positive vs 0.3 negative adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-3 no weight decay is mentioned no bias is mentioned no dropout train for 1000 epochs two Graph Convolutional layers with 100 and 2 neurons respectively We can now define the Graph Convolutional Network architecture using DGL.

Training the GCN model with these parameters led to a poorer performance than the one reported in the paper by Weber et al. The bidirectional graph variant produced the better results. Therefore it is also probably the setting used in the paper. Even though the Bitcoin flow from one transaction to another is intuitively one-directional, this would mean that, in a GCN, the information would only flow downstream. Having a bidirectional flow of information through the edges of the graph in the GCN makes information available to each node both upstream and downstream from it. This greatly improved the performance of the GCN.\nModel Edges Dropout Precision Recall F1 score GCN (Weber et al.) 0. 0.812 0.512 0.628 GCN unidirectional 0. 0.3764 0.3823 0.3793 GCN bidirectional 0. 0.7860 0.3832 0.5152 In order to figure out, whether there are additional parameters that I did not yet consider in replicating the GCN approach, I performed a series of experiments changing further training parameters and comparing the results. This, in turn, was useful in understanding in what ways the model could be modified to increase its performance.\nAdditional experiments with GCNs Address overfitting by weight decay L2-regularization One observation from the previous learning curves is that the validation loss starts to increase again after ca. 400 epochs, a clear sign of overfitting. One way to address this is to add dropout to the model. In this case, I added weight-decay L2-regularization to improve training.\nI further added a learnable bias to the GCN to see if this improved its performance (it did slightly). The other parameters were left intact.\nquery = \u0026#39;model==\u0026#34;gcn\u0026#34; and onlylocal==False and dropout==\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;\u0026#39; print(f\u0026#34;Plotting {runs.query(query)[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;].nunique()} runs: {runs.query(query)[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;].unique()}\u0026#34;) g = sns.relplot(\u0026#39;epoch\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;train_loss\u0026#39;, col=\u0026#39;weight_decay\u0026#39;, hue=\u0026#39;bidirectional\u0026#39;, style=\u0026#39;nobias\u0026#39;, palette=sns.color_palette(\u0026#34;Set1\u0026#34;, 2), kind=\u0026#39;line\u0026#39;, data=runs.query(query)); plt.ylim(0,1); g = sns.relplot(\u0026#39;epoch\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;val_loss\u0026#39;, col=\u0026#39;weight_decay\u0026#39;, hue=\u0026#39;bidirectional\u0026#39;, style=\u0026#39;nobias\u0026#39;, palette=sns.color_palette(\u0026#34;Set1\u0026#34;, 2), kind=\u0026#39;line\u0026#39;, data=runs.query(query)) plt.ylim(0,1); Plotting 8 runs: ['super-sweep-14' 'blooming-sweep-13' 'vague-sweep-10' 'sandy-sweep-9' 'eternal-sweep-6' 'resilient-sweep-5' 'ethereal-sweep-2' 'vibrant-sweep-1'] query = \u0026#39;model==\u0026#34;gcn\u0026#34; and onlylocal==False and dropout==0\u0026#39; print(f\u0026#34;Plotting {runs.query(query)[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;].nunique()} runs: {runs.query(query)[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;].unique()}\u0026#34;) sns.relplot(\u0026#39;epoch\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;val_f1_score\u0026#39;, col=\u0026#39;weight_decay\u0026#39;, hue=\u0026#39;bidirectional\u0026#39;, style=\u0026#39;nobias\u0026#39;, palette=sns.color_palette(\u0026#34;Set1\u0026#34;, 2), kind=\u0026#39;line\u0026#39;, data=runs.query(query)); Plotting 8 runs: ['super-sweep-14' 'blooming-sweep-13' 'vague-sweep-10' 'sandy-sweep-9' 'eternal-sweep-6' 'resilient-sweep-5' 'ethereal-sweep-2' 'vibrant-sweep-1'] Address overfitting by adding dropout Another way to address this is to add dropout to the model. In this case, I added dropout before the second GCN layer (meaning that the inputs to the 2nd layer will be dropped out with a certain probability. Adding dropout considerably increased the precision, meaning that the model predicts far fewer false negatives. The recall, on the other hand, remains largely unchanged.

Weber et al. show that the node embeddings that can be extracted from a GCN can help boost other traditional models. This makes sense intuitively: because of the networked nature of the bitcoin transactions, knowing the context or \u0026ldquo;neighborhood\u0026rdquo; of a transaction should add important information.\nHowever, from the description of the Elliptic dataset we know that some of the features already contain information regarding the context of the transactions. In fact, 72 out of the 166 features are aggregated features. Therefore, I was curious to find out how would a GCN model perform with only the remaining 94 local features (including timestep) as inputs.\nI modified the model to limit the set of features to only the local ones (including timestep). The input node features thus now have a shape of (94,). This way we can assess the performance of a GCN without having to manually engineer features from their neighbors. In other words, we leave the feature engineering to the neural network itself.\n# consider only the first 94 features of the node feature matrix features_local = g_bi.ndata[\u0026#34;features_matrix\u0026#34;][:,0:94].float() print(f\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Number of features (all): {features.shape[1]}\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Number of features (only local): {features_local.shape[1]}\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) Number of features (all): 166 Number of features (only local): 94 # GCN model parameters #params = { # \u0026#34;bidirectional\u0026#34; : True, # \u0026#34;n_hidden\u0026#34; : 100, # \u0026#34;n_layers\u0026#34; : 2, # \u0026#34;weight_decay\u0026#34; : 5e-4, # \u0026#34;bias\u0026#34; : True, # \u0026#34;dropout\u0026#34; : 0.25, # \u0026#34;epochs\u0026#34; : 1000, # \u0026#34;lr\u0026#34; : 1e-3, # \u0026#34;posweight\u0026#34; : 0.7, #} # #model, metrics = train_eval_model(GCN, g_bi, features_local, **params) query = \u0026#39;model==\u0026#34;gcn\u0026#34; and bidirectional==True and weight_decay==0.0005 and nobias==\u0026#34;False\u0026#34; and (dropout==0 or dropout==0.25 or dropout==0.5)\u0026#39; print(f\u0026#34;Plotting {runs.query(query)[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;].nunique()} runs: {runs.query(query)[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;].unique()}\u0026#34;) sns.relplot(\u0026#39;epoch\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;val_f1_score\u0026#39;, col=\u0026#39;onlylocal\u0026#39;, hue=\u0026#39;dropout\u0026#39;, palette=sns.color_palette(\u0026#34;Set1\u0026#34;, 3), kind=\u0026#39;line\u0026#39;, data=runs.query(query)); Plotting 6 runs: ['divine-sweep-4' 'faithful-sweep-3' 'zesty-microwave-76' 'quiet-deluge-19' 'divine-sweep-11' 'sandy-sweep-9'] We can see that the perfomance of the GCN improved by addition of dropout when all features were considered, but not when using only local features. This makes sense, as the aggregated features are likely less essential than the local ones.\nRandom Forest benchmark A sobering additional finding from the paper by Weber et al. was the out-of-the-box excellent performance of a simple Random Forest in correctly classifying the transactions as licit or illicit. I was able to replicate these results too for two different sets of features:\nAll features Only local features from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier # function to evaluate the model def evaluate_rfc(model, features, labels, mask): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Calculate the loss, accuracy, precision, recall and f1_score for the masked data\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; pred_rfc = model.predict(features[mask]) labels = labels[mask] p, r, f, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(labels, pred_rfc) return p[1], r[1], f[1] # confusion matrix def eval_confusion_matrix_rfc(model, features, labels, mask): pred_rfc = model.predict(features[mask]) labels = labels[mask] print(confusion_matrix(labels, pred_rfc)) Using all features (local + aggregated) rfc = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_features=50, random_state=seed) rfc.fit(features[train_indices], labels[train_indices]) p, r, f1 = evaluate_rfc(rfc, features, labels, val_indices) print( f\u0026#34;Precision {p:.4f} | Recall {r:.4f} | \u0026#34; f\u0026#34;F1 score {f1:.4f}\u0026#34; ) print(\u0026#34;Confusion matrix:\u0026#34;) eval_confusion_matrix_rfc(rfc, features, labels, val_indices) Precision 0.9167 | Recall 0.7211 | F1 score 0.8072 Confusion matrix: [[15516 71] [ 302 781]] The best results were obtained using as input all available features (local (including timestep) + aggregated). Both precision and recall of this model were high. This is confirmed by looking at the confusion matrix. The model predicts nearly no false positives and less than 30% of the illicit transactions are falsely labeled as negatives. It is a very good performance for such a simple model.\nUsing local features only rfc_local = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_features=50, random_state=seed) rfc_local.fit(features_local[train_indices], labels[train_indices]) p, r, f1 = evaluate_rfc(rfc_local, features_local, labels, val_indices) print( f\u0026#34;Precision {p:.4f} | Recall {r:.4f} | \u0026#34; f\u0026#34;F1 score {f1:.4f}\u0026#34; ) eval_confusion_matrix_rfc(rfc_local, features_local, labels, val_indices) Precision 0.8749 | Recall 0.7036 | F1 score 0.7799 [[15478 109] [ 321 762]] Removing the aggregated features from the input to the Random Forest (leaving other parameters equal) impairs its performance both in precision and recall, but not dramatically. It still is a very good model working out of the box. It makes sense that not having information about the immediate neighbors of a transaction would produce a worse-performing model.\nComparison to GCN So what do the resuls of the Random Forest tell us about GCNs and other deep learning techniques? Should we dismiss them and focus on simpler models instead? While this analysis shows that it pays to start simple and see how well we can tackle a task using classic machine learning methods first, there still are valid reasons why one should consider (graph) neural networks too.\nDeep learning on graphs is cool! Now, seriously,\nThere is information contained in the connections between data points, which is not being considered by a classical machine learning approach, unless carefully crafted features are available, which requires time and specific knowledge The features available to a different dataset may be less informative than those in the Elliptic dataset, and therefore insufficient to produce a good-enough Random Forest model There may even be situations when no intrinsic node features are available and we still want to be able to classify transactions. This would still be possible using a GCN but not with a Random Forest Progress in unleashing the potential of GCNs can only be obtained by researching these networks Now let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at a different kind of graph-based model that, I figured, might be a good option for the bitcoin transaction classification task.\nLong-range propagation of label predictions using APPNP Let\u0026rsquo;s recapitulate.\nWe trained a complex GCN model to classify bitcoin transactions as licit or illicit and improved its performance by better parameters and training We found that a Random Forest model performed better than our complex GCN, almost effortlessly Why is this? In order to look for the answer it pays to take a closer look at how the transaction graph is structured. Let\u0026rsquo;s take for example the transactions of the last timestep.\nwith sns.axes_style(\u0026#39;white\u0026#39;): plt.figure(figsize=(8,6)) node_label = list(nx.get_node_attributes(g_nx_t_list[49-1], \u0026#39;label\u0026#39;).values()) mapping = {-1:\u0026#39;grey\u0026#39;, 0:\u0026#39;C0\u0026#39;, 1:\u0026#39;C3\u0026#39;} node_color = [mapping[l] for l in node_label] nx.draw_networkx(g_nx_t_list[49-1], node_size=10, node_color=node_color, with_labels=False, width=0.2, alpha=0.8, arrowsize=8) leg = plt.legend([\u0026#39;unlabeled\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;licit\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;illicit\u0026#39;]) leg.legendHandles[0].set_color(\u0026#39;grey\u0026#39;) leg.legendHandles[1].set_color(\u0026#39;C0\u0026#39;) leg.legendHandles[2].set_color(\u0026#39;C3\u0026#39;) plt.show() /anaconda3/envs/dgl/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py:579: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: The iterable function was deprecated in Matplotlib 3.1 and will be removed in 3.3.

Use np.iterable instead. if cb.iterable(node_size): # many node sizes The original paper describing the GCN applied it to the node classification of papers in the Cora dataset. The bitcoin transaction graph is much larger and less dense than the Cora graph. One can hipothesize that for a denser graph with a higher average degree, each node could receive more information from its neighbors that would help make a GCN make a better prediction.\nGraph Nodes Density Average degree Elliptic (bitcoin transactions) 203769 0.0003177 2.30 Cora (citations) 2708 0.0014812 3.90 Furthermore, if we consider a simple chain of transactions (like the ones seen in the graph visualization), a node would receive information only from the previous node and pass it on only to the following node in the chain. In such a situation, it could be that the range of neighbors that feed the classification of any given node is too short and often not sufficient for a correct prediction. If this is the case, then considering a longer-ranging neighborhood could help train a better classification model.\nApproximated Personalized Propagation of Neural Predictions (APPNP) Enter APPNP. This model was recently proposed as a way to reconcile the best of two worlds: neural message passing algorithms (in principle like the GCN), and personalized pagerank.\nIn PageRank, a measure of how central or important a node is calculated as a function of its connections and the importance of its neighbors. The pagerank $PR$ of a node $u$ is:\n$$PR(u) = (1-d){1 \\over {N}} + d \\sum_{v \\in \\mathcal{N} (u)} {PR(v) \\over D_{out}(v)}$$where $N$ is the total number of nodes, $D_{out}$ is the outdegree, and $v$ is a node of the set of neighbors $\\mathcal{N}$ of $u$. Pagerank ultimately requires each node to iteratively receive information from its neighbors until the pagerank stops changing and converges. The algorithm assigns a damping factor $d$, which can be understood by imagining a random surfer visiting nodes in the graph. The surfer would visit any given node moving along the edges of the graph until it reaches it with probability $d$. However, that surfer could also visit a node by randomly teleporting to it from elsewhere in the graph with probability $(1-d)$.\nIn APPNP, a multilayer perceptron takes the node features as input and outputs prediction probabilities $H^{0} = f_{MLP}(X)$. These are then propagated through graph for a $K$ number of iterations.\n$$H^{t+1} = (1-\\alpha)\\left(\\hat{D}^{-1/2} \\hat{A} \\hat{D}^{-1/2} H^{t}\\right) + \\alpha H^{0}$$If you think the APPNP and the pagerank equations look similar is because they are. The teleportation probability $\\alpha$ corresponds to the damping factor in pagerank. It tells us that for each iteration, the predictions for a node will depend on the normalized graph laplacian with probability $(1-\\alpha)$ or on the output of the MLP with probability $\\alpha$.\nSo how does do we train the APPNP model? I modified an implementation of an APPNP layer from DGL. In the original paper by Klicpera et al. (2019) they use an architecture consisting of a 2-layer MLP with 64 hidden units each, followed by the propagation component given by the APPNP equation. In order to use a comparable architecture to the GCN model, I decided to set the number of hidden units to 100 (same as previous section).\nI tested several combinations of values for $K$ and $\\alpha$. However, a more exhaustive hyperparameter search is needed to find the best possible configuration. Moreover, I used two versions of the feature set: all features vs. only local features.\nThe best F1 score was obtained for $K = 20$ propagation iterations and a teleportation probability $\\alpha = 0.2$. Interestingly, the model trained with only local features performed better than using all features. Furthermore, the addition of dropout to the network had a positive effect when using all features, but a negative effect if only local features were considered.\nclass APPNP(nn.Module): def __init__( self, g, in_feats, n_hidden, n_classes, n_layers, activation, feat_drop, edge_drop, alpha, k, ): super(APPNP, self).__init__() self.g = g self.layers = nn.ModuleList() # input layer self.layers.append(nn.Linear(in_feats, n_hidden)) # hidden layers for _ in range(n_layers - 2): self.layers.append(nn.Linear(n_hidden, n_hidden)) # output layer self.layers.append(nn.Linear(n_hidden, n_classes)) self.activation = activation if feat_drop: self.feat_drop = nn.Dropout(feat_drop) else: self.feat_drop = lambda x: x self.propagate = APPNPConv(k, alpha, edge_drop) self.reset_parameters() def reset_parameters(self): for layer in self.layers: layer.reset_parameters() def forward(self, features): # prediction step h = features h = self.feat_drop(h) h = self.activation(self.layers[0](h)) for layer in self.layers[1:-1]: h = self.activation(layer(h)) h = self.layers[-1](self.feat_drop(h)) # propagation step h = self.propagate(self.g, h) return h query = \u0026#39;model==\u0026#34;appnp\u0026#34; and nhidden==100 and bidirectional==True and weight_decay==0.0005 and nobias==\u0026#34;False\u0026#34; and (dropout==0 or dropout==0.2 or dropout==0.25)\u0026#39; print(f\u0026#34;Plotting {runs.query(query)[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;].nunique()} runs: {runs.query(query)[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;].unique()}\u0026#34;) sns.relplot(\u0026#39;epoch\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;val_f1_score\u0026#39;, row=\u0026#39;onlylocal\u0026#39;, col=\u0026#39;alpha\u0026#39;, hue=\u0026#39;k\u0026#39;, style=\u0026#39;dropout\u0026#39;, palette=sns.color_palette(\u0026#34;Set1\u0026#34;, 2), kind=\u0026#39;line\u0026#39;, data=runs.query(query)); Plotting 12 runs: ['tough-sweep-4' 'fluent-sweep-3' 'happy-sweep-2' 'eager-sweep-1' 'vivid-sweep-2' 'copper-sweep-1' 'classic-sweep-10' 'confused-sweep-9' 'generous-sweep-6' 'dulcet-sweep-5' 'avid-sweep-2' 'giddy-sweep-1'] MLP benchmark But just how much of an effect does the incorporation of the graph structure have on the performance of the model? How much of it is simply due to the MLP that is trained on top of the propagation phase of the APPNP? In order to assess this, I trained an MLP model with the same architecture and for the two different versions of the features set.\nThe results show that the APPNP model has a better F1 score than the MLP after 1000 epochs, both for the only local feature set and the full feature set. With respect to precision and F1 score, the addition of dropout was beneficial when using all features and prejudicial when using the local features only. In contrast, recall was slightly improved by adding dropout to both feature variants.\nclass MLP(nn.Module): def __init__( self, in_feats, n_hidden, n_classes, n_layers, activation, feat_drop, ): super(MLP, self).__init__() self.layers = nn.ModuleList() # input layer self.layers.append(nn.Linear(in_feats, n_hidden)) # hidden layers for _ in range(n_layers - 2): self.layers.append(nn.Linear(n_hidden, n_hidden)) # output layer self.layers.append(nn.Linear(n_hidden, n_classes)) self.activation = activation if feat_drop: self.feat_drop = nn.Dropout(feat_drop) else: self.feat_drop = lambda x: x self.reset_parameters() def reset_parameters(self): for layer in self.layers: layer.reset_parameters() def forward(self, features): # prediction step h = features h = self.feat_drop(h) h = self.activation(self.layers[0](h)) for layer in self.layers[1:-1]: h = self.activation(layer(h)) h = self.layers[-1](self.feat_drop(h)) return h #hide_input query = \u0026#39;((model==\u0026#34;appnp\u0026#34;

in the title. This was a research competition at Kaggle in cooperation with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).\nThe goal of the competition was to create a machine learning algorithm that can classify genetic variations that are present in cancer cells.\nTumors contain cells with many different abnormal mutations in their DNA: some of these mutations are the drivers of tumor growth, whereas others are neutral and considered passengers. Normally, mutations are manually classified into different categories after literature review by clinicians. The dataset made available for this competition contains mutations that have been manually anotated into 9 different categories. The goal is to predict the correct category of mutations in the test set.\nThe model and submission described here got me to the 140th place (out of 1386 teams) or top 11%.\nData The data comes in two different kinds of files: one of them contains information about the genetic variants (training_variants and stage2_test_variants.csv) and the other contains the text (clinical evidence) that was used to manually classify the variants (training_text and stage2_test_text.csv). The training data contains a class target feature corresponding to one of the 9 categories that variants can be classified as.\nNote: the \u0026ldquo;stage2\u0026rdquo; prefix of the test files is due to the nature of the competition. There was an initial test set that was used at the beginning of the competition and a \u0026ldquo;stage2\u0026rdquo; test set that was used in the final week before the deadline to make the submissions.\nimport os import re import string import pandas as pd import numpy as np train_variant = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;input/training_variants\u0026#34;) test_variant = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;input/stage2_test_variants.csv\u0026#34;) train_text = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;input/training_text\u0026#34;, sep=\u0026#34;\\|\\|\u0026#34;, engine=\u0026#39;python\u0026#39;, header=None, skiprows=1, names=[\u0026#34;ID\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Text\u0026#34;]) test_text = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;input/stage2_test_text.csv\u0026#34;, header=None, skiprows=1, names=[\u0026#34;ID\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Text\u0026#34;]) train = pd.merge(train_variant, train_text, how=\u0026#39;left\u0026#39;, on=\u0026#39;ID\u0026#39;) train_y = train[\u0026#39;Class\u0026#39;].values train_x = train.drop(\u0026#39;Class\u0026#39;, axis=1) train_size=len(train_x) print(\u0026#39;Number of training variants: %d\u0026#39; % (train_size)) # number of train data : 3321 test_x = pd.merge(test_variant, test_text, how=\u0026#39;left\u0026#39;, on=\u0026#39;ID\u0026#39;) test_size=len(test_x) print(\u0026#39;Number of test variants: %d\u0026#39; % (test_size)) # number of test data : 5668 test_index = test_x[\u0026#39;ID\u0026#39;].values all_data = np.concatenate((train_x, test_x), axis=0) all_data = pd.DataFrame(all_data) all_data.columns = [\u0026#34;ID\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Gene\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Variation\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Text\u0026#34;] Number of training variants: 3321 Number of test variants: 986 all_data.head() .dataframe thead th { text-align: left; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } The data from the different train and test files is now consolidated into one single file. This is necessary for the correct vectorization of the text data and categorical data later on. We can see that the text information resembles scientific article text. We will process this consolidated file in the next step.\nPreprocessing In order to be able to use this data to train a machine learning model, we need to extract the features from the dataset. This means that we have to transform the text data into vectors that can be understood by an algorithm.

An important difference with respect to my previous MNIST example is that I added an additional regularization term to the cost function. I used L2 regularization to penalize the weights in all four layers. The bias was not penalized as this is not necessary. The strictness of this penalty was given by a beta constant defined at 0.01.\nWhy use additional regularization? Because this allowed me to decrease the variance, i.e. decrease the difference in performance of the model with the training set compared to the validation set. This produced my best submission in the competition.\ndef model(X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test, learning_rate=0.0001, num_epochs=1000, minibatch_size=64, print_cost=True): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Implements a four-layer tensorflow neural network: (LINEAR-\u0026gt;RELU)^3-\u0026gt;LINEAR-\u0026gt;SOFTMAX.

Moreover the accuracy (defined here as the fraction of correct predictions) is very high (97.9%) for the training data and only 64.3% for the validation set.

Now more than ever, particularly in developed countries, we have access to the latest advancements in medicine. This contrasts with the challenge of making those treatments available to as many patients as possible. It is imperative to find ways maximize the positive impact on the quality of life of patients, while maintaining a sustainable health care system. For this purpose I performed an analysis of Medicare data in the USA. Furthermore I used a drug-disease open database to cluster the costs by disease. I identified the most expensive diseases (mostly chronic diseases such as Diabetes) and the most expensive medicines. A drug for the treatment of HCV infections (Harvoni) stands out with the highest total costs in 2015. After this first exploration, I propose the in-depth analysis of further data to enable more targeted conclusions and recommendations to improve health care, such as linking of price databases to compare drug costs for the similar indications or the analysis of population data registers that document life style characteristics of healthy and sick individuals to identify those at risk of developing high-cost diseases.\nRelevance Health care costs amount to a considerable part of the national budgets all over the world. In 2015, $3.2 trillion were spent for health care in the USA (17.8% of its GDP). In Germany, the health care spending reached 11.3% of GDP in 2014. On the one hand, this high health care costs can be explained by the population growth, particularly the elderly proportion, requiring higher investments to secure quality of life. On the other hand, new medicines are continously being discovered enabling the treatment of diseases that were once a sentence of death. This has as a consequence that many once fatal diseases have now become chronic with a high burden on the health care costs.\nBut how can governments and insurers make sure that patients receive the care they need, including latest technology advances, without bankrupting the system? One first step is the identification of high-cost diseases and drugs. This insights can then be used to identify population segments at high-risk of developing a disease, who can then be the focus of prevention measures.\nGovernments, insurers, patient organizations, pharmaceutical and biotech companies need all to leverage their available data, if we are to improve the health of patients now and in future generations.\nMethods Data sources Medicare Drug Spending Data 2011-2015: drug spending and utilization data. In this analysis only Medicare Part D drugs were considered (drugs patients generally administer themselves) Therapeutic Targets Database: Drug-to-disease mapping with ICD identifiers. Tools pandas for data crunching fuzzywuzzy for fuzzy logic matching git for version control Data preprocessing First, I cleaned up and processed the drug spending data available from Medicare for the years 2011-2015. This data includes the total spending, claim number, and beneficiary number \u0026ndash;among others\u0026ndash; for each drug identified by its brand and generic names.\nimport numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns sns.set_palette(\u0026#39;Paired\u0026#39;) sns.set_style(\u0026#39;whitegrid\u0026#39;) %matplotlib inline import warnings warnings.filterwarnings(\u0026#39;ignore\u0026#39;) data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;data/medicare_data_disease.csv\u0026#39;) data.head() I also processed the data from the Therapeutic Targets Database, which presents the indications (diseases) associated with a drug generic name.\ndiseases = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;data/drug-disease_keys.csv\u0026#39;) diseases.head() Then, I used a fuzzy logic algorithm to match each drug generic name of the Medicare data with the closest element from the Therapeutic Targets Database. After having a list of exact matches, I assigned the first associated indication to each Medicare drug.

The total spending per indication decreases rapidly by going down the list of drugs.\nDiabetes occupies the first place in this list with a total 5-year spending exceding $50 billion. Following in the list, we find other chronic diseases such as schizophrenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension (high blood pressure), hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol), depression, hiv infections, multiple sclerosis, peptic ulcer disease, and chronic HCV infection (hepatitis C). Interestingly, pain medications are also in the top 4 indications by total spending.\nIt makes sense that treatment of chronic diseases receives the highest investment in drug spending, as patients with these diseases can live long lives when medicated.\nInterestingly, the first cancer reaches only the 19th place of this list (chronic myelogenous leukemia). However, it must be noted that cancer is actually a collection of different diseases with different genetics, origin, and treatment options. These different cancers were not clustered in this analysis.\nDrugs (right part) When we look at the most expensive drugs for the total 5-year spending, we find on the top of the list: Lantus (insulin), nexium (peptic ulcer), and crestor(anti cholesterol). It makes sense as these are medicines to treat chronic diseases.\nHowever, we cannot learn much on a high level from looking at the total spending only. Therefore, a closer look is needed.\nFigure 2: Drug spending is growing but at very heterogeneous rates spend_2015_ind = data[data[\u0026#39;Year\u0026#39;]==2015].groupby(\u0026#39;Indication\u0026#39;).sum().sort_values(by=\u0026#39;Total Spending\u0026#39;, ascending=False) #spend_2015_drug = data[data[\u0026#39;Year\u0026#39;]==2015].groupby(\u0026#39;Brand Name\u0026#39;).sum().sort_values(by=\u0026#39;Total Spending\u0026#39;, # ascending=False) spend_2015_ind.head() top_10_spend = data[data[\u0026#39;Year\u0026#39;]==2015].sort_values(by=\u0026#39;Total Spending\u0026#39;, ascending=False)[[\u0026#39;Brand Name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Total Spending\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Year\u0026#39;]][:10] top_10_spend fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, sharey=False, figsize=(8,5)) g=sns.factorplot(x=\u0026#39;Year\u0026#39;, y=\u0026#39;Total Spending\u0026#39;, hue=\u0026#39;Brand Name\u0026#39;, palette=\u0026#39;coolwarm\u0026#39;, hue_order=top_10_spend[\u0026#39;Brand Name\u0026#39;], data=data[data[\u0026#39;Brand Name\u0026#39;].isin(top_10_spend[\u0026#39;Brand Name\u0026#39;])], ax=ax1) ax1.set_title(\u0026#39;Annual spending for top 10 drugs\u0026#39;) ax1.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Total Spending $\u0026#39;) plt.close(g.fig) ax2.scatter(x=spend_2015_ind[\u0026#39;Beneficiary Count\u0026#39;][:100], y=spend_2015_ind[\u0026#39;Total Spending\u0026#39;][:100], s=spend_2015_ind[\u0026#39;Claim Count\u0026#39;][:100]/100000, #c=spend_2015_ind.reset_index()[\u0026#39;Indication\u0026#39;][:100]) color=sns.xkcd_rgb[\u0026#39;dodger blue\u0026#39;], alpha=0.75) ax2.set_title(\u0026#39;Top 100 indications in 2015\u0026#39;) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;Beneficiary Count\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Total Spending $\u0026#39;) plt.axis([0, None, 0, None]) for label, x, y in zip(spend_2015_ind.index, spend_2015_ind[\u0026#39;Beneficiary Count\u0026#39;][:10], spend_2015_ind[\u0026#39;Total Spending\u0026#39;][:10]): plt.annotate(label, xy=(x, y), color=\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;, alpha=0.75) fig.suptitle(\u0026#39;Annual drug spending development and overview of highest-cost indications\u0026#39;, size=16) plt.tight_layout() fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.85) plt.savefig(\u0026#39;Top_bubble_disease_drug.png\u0026#39;, dpi=300, bbox_inches=\u0026#39;tight\u0026#39;) Annual spending development for top 10 drugs (left) The drug landscape is not temporally static. Therefore, I analyzed the annual spending since 2011 for the 10 top drugs in 2015. Eight out of these ten drugs consistently received higher spending every year, a reflection of the general health care spending panorama. However, the rate of growth for each drug is dramatically different. Particularly striking is the case of the drug Harvoni, which exhibited a \u0026gt;7-fold growth in total spending between 2014 and 2015.\nHarvoni is a medicine for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV infection) that was launched in 2014. It is the first drug with cure rates close to 100%. Harvoni practically cures a chronic disease and this is reflected in its pricing at over $90k for a 12 week treatment.\nThe remaining drugs in the figure are mostly used for the treatment of chronic diseases.\nBut how can we more extensively evaluate the burden posed by the different diseases/indications?\nTop 100 indications in 2015 (right) In order to find out more about the distribution of the most expensive indications, I plotted the drug spendings grouped by indication for the year 2015 in a scatter plot. This way, we can not only look at the total spending but also at the number of beneficiaries for a particular indication. The size of the bubbles represents the relative number of claims.\nFrom this graph we can assess the magnitude of how the most expensive diseases affect society. Diabetes is not only the most expensive single indication by total spending but also affects a very large number of people.\nThe indications with the most beneficiaries are hypertension, pain and high cholesterol. They also represent some of the highest number of claims (bubble size). This indicates that the average cost associated with each claim is low, as these are generally medications with expired patents that are priced very low.\nAgain it is interesting to take a look at chronic HCV infection. This is the indication for the drug Harvoni. Both the number of beneficiaries and claims are extremely low compared with other diseases. However, chronic HCV infection reached the second place in the highes total drug spending in 2015.\nNext steps I have shown in this analysis that very interesting insights can be gained from analyzing a smaller set of publicly available data. It follows that a more detailed and deeper analysis could enable more targeted conclusions and recommendations for improving the health care system and the quality of life of patients suffering from disease.\nAccess to non-public owned data would make even deeper analysis possible.\nAdditional analysis could include:\nClustering of diseases/indications to higher-level categories (cancer, metabolic disease, circulatory disease, nervous system disease, etc.) Linking of price databases to compare drug costs for the same indication on a population level Analysis of population data registers that document life style characteristics of healthy and ill individuals to identify those at risk of developing high-cost diseases (e.g. Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data) Limitations One limitation from this analysis is that only Part D drugs were considered. A further analysis could include Part B drugs too.\nMoreover it was assumed that the fuzzy logic matching was successful in most cases. A more detailed test is required to assess match success more stringently.\nAll conclusions are only valid for the 2011-2015 interval. No data for 2016 was analyzed.\n","permalink":"https://www.arcosdiaz.com/posts/2017-02-06-medicare-drug-cost/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHealth care systems world-wide are under pressure due to the high costs associated with disease.

Moreover, we want to have a continuous time series, including those days in which none of the two events took place (no earthquakes, and no movie releases). We do this by using the concatenate and resample functions of pandas.\n# Concatenate both DataFrames into one df = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True) df = df.set_index(pd.DatetimeIndex(df.Date)) df = df.sort_index() df = df.resample(\u0026#39;1d\u0026#39;).sum().fillna(0) # to complete every day df.head(10) .dataframe thead th { text-align: left; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } Calculating and plotting a moving average We could simply plot each event occurrence as a data point in a time series. However, this will likely yield a graph that is not very informative. Much easier to grasp is a moving average that tells us the average frequency of the events for a defined period of time in the past. We can create columns for these moving averages, which we can then easily plot.\n# Calculate moving average for i in [7*4, 7*4*2]: mvav = i # moving average period, i.e. number of points to average dfi = np.convolve(df[\u0026#39;earthquake\u0026#39;], np.ones((mvav,))*7/mvav # factor for obtaining average , mode=\u0026#39;full\u0026#39;) df[\u0026#39;earthquake moving average %sw\u0026#39; % (int(i/7))] = dfi[:-(i-1)] dfj = np.convolve(df[\u0026#39;movie_release\u0026#39;], np.ones((mvav,))*7/mvav # factor for obtaining average , mode=\u0026#39;full\u0026#39;) df[\u0026#39;movie_release moving average %sw\u0026#39; % (int(i/7))] = dfj[:-(i-1)] df.head() .dataframe thead th { text-align: left; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } The shorter the period that we choose for the moving average, the noisier our graphic will get. Let\u0026rsquo;s settle with a moving average that reflects the frequency during the past 8 weeks. And voilà! Now we can see how the frequency of earthquakes and movie releases changed over time.\n# Plot relevant columns from dataframe df.loc[:,[\u0026#39;earthquake moving average 8w\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;movie_release moving average 8w\u0026#39;]].\\ plot(cmap=\u0026#39;Set2\u0026#39;, figsize=(12,4))# possible plt.xlim(df.index[0], df.index.max()+10) plt.title(\u0026#39;Moving average of events per week\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Frequency\u0026#39;) plt.show() Descriptive analysis of the event occurrence What other insights can we get from this data set? Two very dissimilar series of events, one natural, and one man-made, will surely have very different properties. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a simple question: on which days of the week do both events typically happen?\n#%% DAY OF THE WEEK ANALYSIS # create column for day of the week df[\u0026#39;Day\u0026#39;] = df.index.dayofweek df[\u0026#39;Day\u0026#39;] = df.Day.astype(\u0026#39;category\u0026#39;) df.Day.cat.categories = [\u0026#39;Mon\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Tue\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Wed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Thu\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Fri\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Sat\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Sun\u0026#39;] # create column for type df[\u0026#39;Type\u0026#39;] = np.where(df[\u0026#39;earthquake\u0026#39;]\u0026gt;0, \u0026#39;earthquake\u0026#39;, np.where(df[\u0026#39;movie_release\u0026#39;]\u0026gt;0,\\ \u0026#39;movie_release\u0026#39;, np.nan)) df[\u0026#39;Type\u0026#39;] = df[\u0026#39;Type\u0026#39;].astype(\u0026#39;category\u0026#39;) df[\u0026#39;Type\u0026#39;] = df[\u0026#39;Type\u0026#39;].cat.remove_categories([\u0026#39;nan\u0026#39;]) # show count for each day #df[(df.Event1 == 1)\u0026amp;(df.Day == \u0026#39;Mon\u0026#39;)].Day.count() # plot count data per day of the week plt.figure() plt.title(\u0026#39;Event count per day of the week\u0026#39;) sns.countplot(data=df, x=\u0026#39;Day\u0026#39;, hue=\u0026#39;Type\u0026#39;) sns.despine(left=True) plt.show() We can see that nature does not respect our weekends, as earthquakes seem to be flatly distributed by day of the week.\nThe movie releases, on the other hand, are most frequent on Friday, followed by Wednesday and a few on Sunday (it\u0026rsquo;s almost as if movie release days were chosen by someone\u0026hellip; /s). It seems that, if you\u0026rsquo;re planning to release a new movie in the US, Friday is the way to go. People are usually happy to start the weekend with a leisurely activity, so that makes sense. As of why Saturdays and Sundays are almost not used as movie release days, even though on this days people are also usually free from work, it would be interesting to find out why. Another intriguing finding is the not high but remarkable number of releases on Wednesdays. Don\u0026rsquo;t people work on Thursdays?\nAnalysis of frequency per week The world is a big place (or is it a small world?) and earthquakes occur all the time, even though we might not always find out. On the other hand, I would expect that movie releases occur much more frequently. So let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the data by plotting histograms for both events side by side.\n# joint histograms plt.figure() df[\u0026#39;earthquake moving average 8w\u0026#39;].hist(alpha=.9) df[\u0026#39;movie_release moving average 8w\u0026#39;].hist(alpha=.9) plt.title(\u0026#39;Histogram of event frequency per week\u0026#39;) plt.show() # With seaborn sns.distplot(df[\u0026#39;earthquake moving average 8w\u0026#39;]), \\ sns.distplot(df[\u0026#39;movie_release moving average 8w\u0026#39;]) (\u0026lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x11eb49198\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x11eb49198\u0026gt;) Luckily, movie releases are much more frequent per week as earthquakes. On most weeks, there are between two and three movie releases, compared to 0.5 to 1.5 earthquakes.\nFinal remarks In this post, we gathered information on the occurrence of two events: earthquakes around the world, and movie releases in the US. By plotting their moving averages we could better compare when they occurred and gained some interesting insights about how they compare.

Luckily, it is already possible to model the future using Python to gain insights into a number of problems from many different areas. In marketing, being able to model how successful a new product will be, would be of great use. In this post, I will take a look at how we can model the future revenue of a product by making certain assumptions and running a Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation.\nWhat are Monte Carlo methods? Wikipedia tells us that:\nMonte Carlo methods (or Monte Carlo experiments) are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Their essential idea is using randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.\nIn simple terms, we define a number of rules about how a system will behave based on assumptions, and then use random samplings of these conditions over and over and measure the results. We can then look at the results altogether to gain insights into our model.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see this in practice!\nimport numpy as np from pylab import triangular, zeros, percentile from scipy.stats import binom import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns sns.set_palette(\u0026#39;coolwarm\u0026#39;) sns.set_style(\u0026#34;whitegrid\u0026#34;) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline /Users/dario/anaconda/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.5/site-packages/matplotlib/font_manager.py:273: UserWarning: Matplotlib is building the font cache using fc-list.

This may take a moment. warnings.warn('Matplotlib is building the font cache using fc-list. This may take a moment.') Define the initial assumptions What assumptions can we safely make regarding our new product? For example, what is the estimated market size that we want to work with and what is the estimated price that we can expect. We also define the num_timesteps, the number of years for which we want to make the calculations.\n# initial market size assumption (total number of potential users) marketsize_min = 5000 marketsize_mode = 12000 marketsize_max = 15000 marketshare_init = triangular(.003, .005, .01) # min, mode, max # initial percentage of users that use the product price_min=500 # minimum product price price_mode=1000 # mode product price price_max=1500 # maximum product price num_timesteps=10 # number of years for the simulation num_simulations=1024 # number of simulations per year perc_selection = [5, 25, 50, 75, 95] # percentiles to visualize in plots Define the functions to calculate market share and revenue of a product These are the functions used to get the data points by random sampling. Each time we run each function, the variables are randomly defined from a range and a result is obtained, e.g. a market share or a revenue amount.\ndef calc_marketshare(marketsize, marketshare): \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; Calculates product market share for a given year as percentage of users that use the product compared to total number of users Arguments: marketsize : total market size as number of potential users marketshare: observed/assumed percentage of users that use the product \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; share = binom.rvs(marketsize, marketshare, size=1) / marketsize return share def calc_revenue(marketsize, marketshare): \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; Calculates the revenue development over a number of years Arguments: marketsize: total market size as number of potential users marketshare : observed/assumed percentarge of users that use the product \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; product_price = triangular(price_min, price_mode, price_max) volume = marketsize*marketshare revenue = product_price * volume return revenue Additionally, in case that a distribution is not included in the standard statistical modules of Python, we can custom write them. For example, we can define functions to return logistic and sigmoid distributions.\ndef logist(x, loc, scale, factor): \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; Logistic distribution Args: x : variable in x-axis, e.g. time loc : the mean of the distribution, maximum probability scale : steepness of the curve, higher -\u0026gt; steeper factor : multiplies to obtain higher probabilities overall \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; return factor*np.exp((loc-x)/scale)/(scale*(1+np.exp((loc-x)/scale))**2) def sigmoid(x): L, q, loc = 10, 1, 3 return L/(1+np.exp(-q*(x-loc))) Why do we need this logistic distribution? For example, if we want to take into account the market growth in the next ten years, we could simply assume it will be 1% or 2% or 10% and keep it constant. However, we have Python on our side and can rather model this growth in a semi-random way. We assume that the market growth is more likely to be lower (between 0 and 4%) but we want to also consider the lower probability cases in which the growth could be higher, e.g. 8%.\ndef logist_test(x): loc, scale = 2, 2 return 4*np.exp((loc-x)/scale)/(scale*(1+np.exp((loc-x)/scale))**2) x = np.arange(0,10) plt.plot(logist_test(x)) #plt.plot(bins, logist(bins, loc, scale)*count.max()/logist(bins, loc, scale).max()) plt.show() Data collection and simulation Now that we have all assumptions and \u0026ldquo;rules\u0026rdquo; in place, let\u0026rsquo;s get some data points.\nFirst let\u0026rsquo;s create some empty matrixes where we will put the data later.\nu = zeros((num_simulations,), dtype=float) # temporary market size matrix as number of potential users s = zeros((num_simulations,), dtype=float) # temporary market share matrix r = zeros((num_simulations,), dtype=float) # temporary revenue matrix rev = zeros((num_timesteps, num_simulations), dtype=float) # revenue data collection by year percentiles_rev = zeros((num_timesteps,len(perc_selection)), dtype=float) # percentiles_rev data collection by year usr = zeros((num_timesteps, num_simulations), dtype=float) # users data collection by year percentiles_usr = zeros((num_timesteps,len(perc_selection)), dtype=float) # percentiles for total users sha = zeros((num_timesteps, num_simulations), dtype=float) # market share data collection by year percentiles_sha = zeros((num_timesteps,len(perc_selection)), dtype=float) # percentiles for market share Now we can run the simulations to get our data points for the next 10 years.
