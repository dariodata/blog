Hi! I'm a data scientist / neuroscientist / cat lover interested in the complex
dynamics of the world we live in and how we can use data _and_ science to solve
humanity's big and small challenges. One idea at a time. 

Fun fact: I started university when I was 15 years old, and, while I wouldn't
recommend it, it has allowed me to explore many of my interests throughout my
life and to develop a rather diverse set of skills ðŸ™ƒ You can find out more
